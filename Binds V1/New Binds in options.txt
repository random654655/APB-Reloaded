Keyboard weapon switch delay fix
Keyboard delay fix
Bind delay fix

If u want to fix the keyboard delay/bind delay u have to match the keybind u are going to use in game with the one in "Axis aUp Speed=-1000.0" section.
So everytime you change a keybind in game you will have to change it in DefaultInput since it doesn't update itself..If you don't the commmands are still going to work but certain ones will have a delay.
